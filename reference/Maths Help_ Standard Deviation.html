<p><!-- QUESTION HERE -->

I am confused about all the different formulae for standard deviation.
Which one should I use?

Yes, it can be confusing, especially as different textbooks sometimes use 
different notation.
<p>
Basically there are two different standard deviations: <br>
one has DIVISOR n, the other has DIVISOR n-1 <br>
<img src="Sd_form1.gif" align=middle><i><font="-1">NB we have omitted subscripts for clarity</font></i>
<p><ul>
<li>The "divisor n" formula is used if the data set is known to be 
the whole <b>population</b>, i.e. the complete set of data you are interested in.<br>
(This formula is used at GCSE and in introductory courses.)
<li>The "divisor n-1" formula is used when you are working with a 
<b>sample</b> data set, and wish to <i>estimate</i> the standard deviation of 
the parent population.<br>
(This is a more sophisticated concept, met when studying statistical inference.)
</ul>
All the other formulae which you might see are <b>modifications</b> of the above two, 
for example to make the calculations easier to perform by hand, or to use 
if the data is given in the form of a frequency table.
<p>
Since there are too many modifications to list here, we strongly suggest 
you ask your tutor which ones to use, and ignore any others you might 
come across. For example, if you are working towards an exam, you might 
be given a Formula Sheet to refer to, so just practise using the particular 
formulae included there.
<p>
Nowadays, most pocket calculators include statistical functions built in. 
Such calculators have two buttons for standard deviations, one for the 
"divisor&nbsp;n" form and one for the "divisor&nbspn-1" form. 
Make sure you know which is which!
<p>
HINT<br>
If in doubt, note that the standard deviation when working with a <b>sample</b> (divisor&nbsp;n-1) 
will be slightly greater that the standard deviation when working with a <b>population</b> 
(divisor&nbsp;n) because we are only dividing by n-1 rather than n.
